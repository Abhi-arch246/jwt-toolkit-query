            JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
            compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information
            between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified
            and trusted because it is digitally signed.{" "}

          <h2>
            JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a
            public/private key pair using RSA. Letâ€™s explain some concepts of
            this definition further. Compact: Because of its size, it can be
            sent through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header.
            Additionally, due to its size its transmission is fast.
            Self-contained: The payload contains all the required information
            about the user, to avoid querying the database more than once.
